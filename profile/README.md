# missing api

**missing api** is an open source software organization dedicated to bridging the gap for systems that lack proper web APIs. We design, build, and distribute custom APIs and middleware solutions to unlock data and interoperability for legacy or closed platforms.

Typical projects include:
- Consulting and implementing iCal exports and API proxies, such as for municipal waste calendars (e.g., VEVG Karlsburg in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern).
- Generating ICS/iCal feeds for public tour availability from systems like Checkfront, making schedules accessible and integrable.
- Middleware for optimizing and enriching public ICS/iCal feeds from council management systems like Allris, adding meaningful event descriptions and improving usability.

Our mission: to make data accessible, integrable, and useful—wherever official APIs are missing. Find more about our approach and current projects at [schafe-vorm-fenster.com](https://www.schafe-vorm-fenster.com/).
